    <h1>Background</h1>
    <ul>
      <li>
        We are working with social workers and christian missionaries in Brazil
      </li>
      <li>
        Our client manually study and record conditions and development of local communities
      </li>
      <li>
        They are doing this via CAQDAS
      </li>
    </ul>

    <h1>Goal</h1>
    <ul>
      <li>
        Our goal is to help our client visualize and plan strategies for successful interventions
      </li>
    </ul>

    <h1>Project</h1>
    <ul>
      <li>
        We created a plugin in Obsidian to automatically record social factors and does georeferencing of it that is lacking in most CAQDAS tools
      </li>
    </ul>

    <h1>Old</h1>
    <p><a href="https://lookerstudio.google.com/u/0/reporting/52228438-9caf-4adb-be1e-212266a50064/page/ORIUC">Old Software</a></p>

    <ul>
      <li>
        CAQDAS (Computer Assisted Qualitative Data Analysis Software)
      </li>
      <li>
        This is software that provides tools for the user to organize and manage their data
      </li>
      <li>
        The specific software client uses Socio Atlas
      </li>
      <li>
        The problem with this is that it is difficult to use
      </li>
    </ul>

    <h1>New</h1>
    <ul>
      <li>
        Move from SocioAtlas to Obsidian
      </li>
      <li>
        Use a software that will organize our data better than the previous software used by the client
      </li>
      <li>
        Our plugin seeks to organize the social factors within their data with one click
      </li>
    </ul>

    <h1>Improvements</h1>
    <ol>
      <li>
        Continue implementing multiple analysis: interactive visualization map
      </li>
      <li>
        Implement AI system to help our simple analysis: automatically read data and get factors automatically
      </li>
      <li>
        Improve our georeferencing
      </li>
      <li>
        Create the obsidian plugin in a website
      </li>
    </ol>
